# Multi-Block Structure

This uses a hopper right next to any furnace or blast furnace. The hopper needs to have a recipe in it:

Then you need to **throw a fire charge** into the hopper **cavity**, not on the rim. Standard button for throwing is "q". Then you'll hear a "whoosh" sound which lets you know it worked. If you destroy the hopper you get these items back, not the fire charge though.

Then you build either: bricks, nether bricks or red nether bricks around it in any combination:

The iron bars are decoration, they're not needed. You can have any block above the furnace, including a hopper, and also any block above the hopper inside the multi-block structure.
If the furnace is running it displays the item (nether gold ore) that is being smelted in the hopper together with flames and smoke to simulate the effect that something is being smelted:

When the item changes the display of the item does too and when the furnace runs out of fuel or there is no item to smelt the display clears to no item being displayed. If there is any block above this hopper the item and the particles won't be displayed.

The multi-block structure can also be stacked on top of each other:

# Download

[**Download for 1.15.x**](https://github.com/Elemend/Blast-Blast-Furnaces/releases/tag/1.15.x)

[**Download for 1.16.x**](https://github.com/Elemend/Blast-Blast-Furnaces/releases/tag/1.16.x)

The **"blast_blast_furnaces_1.xx.x.zip"** is what you'll need. Save that.


# Installation

Open your minecraft directory, where the savefile for your world is located. Your worldsave contains a folder "datapacks", where the zipfile needs to be copied into. Minecraft will enable new availabe datapacks on a restart of the world. If the world is currently running, you will need to type the command: **/reload** into chat. If the datapack doesn't show up in the advancement screen I suggest you first try to run the reload command.


# Known Problems:

You can't use this on Minecraft REALMS because predicates don't work there.
